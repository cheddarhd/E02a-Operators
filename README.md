So this assignment took me longer than I thought it was. I was very confused about the point of typine all these functions in and not printing anything and am still confused with the what the main def does with all the information I typed above. All in all whenever I couldn't find the right command for the def I would either just try typing what I thought the function might be and VS code suggested it and used trial and error. Some of the stuff using the random and shuffle I struggled to find the right function for so I had to look up the specific task I was trying to do and I go to where its at now. The errors that popped up when saving the code were also very helpful to fix some mistakes I had along the way. I still have 1 I can not figure out with the shuffle as it says that the function has no return. I tried adding antoher Returnto = 1  but that didn't fix it. All in all getting more comfortable using python and am excited to learn how to make a game engine.
